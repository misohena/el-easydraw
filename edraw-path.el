;;;;; edraw-path-cmd

;;
;; - Corresponds to each command in the d= attribute of the <path> element.
;; - The command types and argument formats are as follows:
;;   - type=M args=((anchor-x . anchor-y))
;;   - type=L args=((anchor-x . anchor-y))
;;   - type=C args=((handle-x1 . handle-y1) (handle-x2 . handle-y2) (anchor-x . anchor-y))
;;   - type=Z args=nil
;;   - type=-forward-handle-point args=((handle-x . handle-y))
;; - Other commands are converted to L or C by edraw-path-cmdlist-from-d.
;; - L and C (or sometimes Z) represent a segment.
;; - This is a doubly-linked list, so you can retrieve the previous and next
;;   commands.
